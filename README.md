# The School App
I wanted to learn and test Vue.js, so I re-did a part of an older project which is a platform for teachers and students. It was a fun project, and I would love to continue it using Vue.js and create a complete project.
| Mobile and desktop view.

## Project setup
To start the project locally: 
  1. Clone or download the app
  2. Open a terminal in the root folder of the project
  3. Install the dependencies with the command `yarn`
  4. Then start the project with `yarn serve`

## Project functionality
  *You can log in as a student (Notendanafn: stud, Lykilorð: stud)
  *As a student, you can ask for help by selecting a teacher to add yourself to his waiting list.
  *You can log in as a teacher (Notendanafn: teach, Lykilorð: teach)
  *As a teacher, you can add an interview card where students would then book a timeslot.

## Stack
This project was built with Vue.js and Sass and the data is stored loacally.
